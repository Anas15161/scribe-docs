# Introduction

Scribe helps you generate API documentation for humans from your Laravel/Lumen/[Dingo](https://github.com/dingo/api) codebase. See a live example at [demo.scribe.knuckles.wtf](https://demo.scribe.knuckles.wtf).

## Features
- Pretty single-page HTML doc, with human-friendly text, code samples, and included in-browser API tester ("Try It Out")
- Extracts body parameters details from FormRequests or validation rules
- Safely calls API endpoints to get sample responses
- Supports generating responses from Transformers or Eloquent API Resources
- Generates Postman collection and OpenAPI spec
- Easily customisable with custom views and included UI components
- Easily extensible with custom strategies
- Statically define extra endpoints that aren't in your codebase

:::tip
Scribe helps you generate docs automatically, but if you really want to make friendly, maintainable and testable API docs, there's some more stuff you need to know. So I made [a course](https://apidocsfordevs.com?utm_source=scribe-laravel-docs&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=none) for you.ðŸ¤—

## Installation

:::info Requirements
PHP 7.4 and Laravel/Lumen 6 or higher are required.
:::

First, add the package via Composer:

```sh
composer require --dev knuckleswtf/scribe
```

Then complete the installation:

import {LaravelLumenTabs, TabItem} from '@site/src/components/LaravelLumenTabs';

<LaravelLumenTabs>
<TabItem value="laravel">

Publish the config file by running:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=scribe-config
```
This will create a `scribe.php` file in your `config` folder.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="lumen">

1. Copy the config file from `vendor/knuckleswtf/scribe/config/scribe.php` to your project as `config/scribe.php`.
2. Add these lines to your `bootstrap/app.php`. They'll ensure that Scribe is loaded, but only in your dev environment:

   ```php title=bootstrap/app.php
   if (class_exists(\Knuckles\Scribe\ScribeServiceProvider::class)) {
       $app->register(\Knuckles\Scribe\ScribeServiceProvider::class);
       $app->configure('scribe');
   }
   ```
3. Add these lines to your `Console/Kernel.php` to enable Artisan commands:
   
   ```php title=Console/Kernel.php
   use Laravel\Lumen\Application;

   public function __construct(Application $app)
    {
        parent::__construct($app);
        if (class_exists(\Knuckles\Scribe\Commands\GenerateDocumentation::class)) {
            $this->commands[] = \Knuckles\Scribe\Commands\GenerateDocumentation::class;
        }
        if (class_exists(\Knuckles\Scribe\Commands\MakeStrategy::class)) {
            $this->commands[] = \Knuckles\Scribe\Commands\MakeStrategy::class;
        }
        if (class_exists(\Knuckles\Scribe\Commands\Upgrade::class)) {
            $this->commands[] = \Knuckles\Scribe\Commands\Upgrade::class;
        }
    }
   ```

</TabItem>
</LaravelLumenTabs>
