# Introduction

Scribe helps you generate API documentation for humans from your Node.js codebase. See a live example at [demo.scribe.knuckles.wtf](https://demo.scribe.knuckles.wtf).

## Features
- Pretty single-page HTML doc, with human-friendly text, code samples, and included in-browser API tester ("Try It Out")
- Safely calls API endpoints to get sample responses
- Generates Postman collection and OpenAPI spec
- Statically define extra endpoints that aren't in your codebase

:::tip
Scribe helps you generate docs automatically, but if you really want to make friendly, maintainable and testable API docs, there's some more stuff you need to know. So I made [a course](https://shalvah.teachable.com/p/api-documentation-for-developers?utm_source=scribe-nodejs-docs&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=none) for you.ðŸ¤—

## Installation

:::info Requirements
Node.js 12.4.0 or higher is required.
:::

Scribe currently supports three frameworks: [AdonisJS v4](https://legacy.adonisjs.com/), [Express v4](https://expressjs.com/) and [Restify v8](http://restify.com/).


import {AdonisExpressRestifyTabs, TabItem} from '@site/src/components/AdonisExpressRestifyTabs';

<AdonisExpressRestifyTabs>
<TabItem value="adonis">

Install with:

```sh
npm i @knuckleswtf/scribe-adonis
```

Then add the service provider to the `aceProviders` array in your `start/app.js`:

```js {3}
const aceProviders = [
  '@adonisjs/lucid/providers/MigrationsProvider',
  '@knuckleswtf/scribe-adonis/providers/ScribeProvider', // <-- Add this
]
```

To generate your docs, run the Ace command `scribe:generate`:

```bash
node ace scribe:generate
```

See the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started/adonis) for more.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="express">

Install with:

```sh
npm i @knuckleswtf/scribe-express
```

To generate your docs, you'll need to locate your "app file" (the file where you create and configure your Express app). Then pass the path to Scribe:

```sh
npx scribe generate -a <your-app-file>.js
```

See the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started/express) for more.


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="restify">

Install with:

```sh
npm i @knuckleswtf/scribe-restify
```

To generate your docs, you'll need to locate your "server file" (the file where you set up and start your Restify server). Then pass the path to Scribe:

```sh
npx scribe generate -s <your-server-file>.js
```

See the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started/restify) for more.

</TabItem>
